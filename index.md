# Intro

[Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) is an Open Source note taking app for
developers. It doesn't come with much documentation, which is fine, because its
straight forward user interface doesn't need a lot of explanation and, well,
note taking is a fairly simple concept, right?

But wait! Boostnote actually goes far beyond the basics by including a bunch of
rendering engines for many different more or less specialized use cases. This
fact is somewhat buried in the release notes and source code. So there's a
chance you are missing out on some of the coolest things you can do with
Boostnote.

To remedy this situation, this little guide aims at bringing to light all the
neat stuff that Boostnote can do while unpretentiously hiding it from you.

# Markdown

Boostnote's basic note format is the nowadays ubiquitous
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is [well
documented](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
[standardized](https://commonmark.org). Check out one of those resources if you
are not familiar with Markdown.

But Boostnote also supports many advanced, non-standardized Markdown features,
which are listed here.
