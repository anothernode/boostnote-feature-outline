# Intro

[Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) is an Open Source note taking app for
developers. It doesn't come with much documentation, which is fine, because it's
straight forward user interface doesn't need a lot of explanation and, well,
note taking is a fairly simple concept, right?

But wait! The Boostnote developers included a bunch of very cool rendering
engines into it. That makes it an overall outstandingly powerful note taking
tool for software technicians and congeneric individuals. The thing is, the
existence of these advanced features, so far, isn't advertised or prominently
documented anywhere, at least not as far as we know. So you might never know how
much you can do with Boostnote, unless you study the release notes and/or the
code.

To remedy this situation, this little guide aims at bringing to light all the
cool things that Boostnote can do while unpretentiously hiding them from you.

# Markdown

Boostnote's basic note format is the nowadays ubiquitous
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is [well
documented](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
[standardized](https://commonmark.org) and there's no way you could be unaware
of this fact after three seconds of using Boostnote. So there's no need to go
into any more detail here.
