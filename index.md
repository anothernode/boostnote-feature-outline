# Intro

[Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) is an Open Source note taking app for
developers. It doesn't come with much documentation, which is fine, because its
straight forward user interface doesn't need a lot of explanation and, well,
note taking is a fairly simple concept, right?

But wait! Boostnote actually goes far beyond the basics by including a bunch of
rendering engines for many different more or less specialized use cases. This
fact is somewhat buried in its release notes and source code. So there's a
chance you are missing out on some of the coolest things you can do with
Boostnote.

To remedy this situation, this little guide aims at bringing to light all the
neat stuff that Boostnote can do while unpretentiously hiding it from you.

It's categorized by the rendering engine used with the more generic _Text
formatting_ category falling out of that scheme and comprising formatting
features that couldn't be matched to a particular rendering engine and are also
not part of the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) specification. The basic
standardized [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) features
are [well documented](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
[elsewhere](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/) and therefore not in the scope of
this guide.

It's also obviously out of scope to describe every single rendering engine in
depth. The idea is just to give you an overview of what Boostnote includes, a
first impression of what the different rendering engines are about and a
reference to their respective project sites to explore them further as needed.

Also have a look at the [Boostnote Markdown
Cheatsheet](https://github.com/TobseF/boostnote-markdown-cheatsheet). It takes a
more encyclopedic approach and this guide owes a lot os inspiration to it.
