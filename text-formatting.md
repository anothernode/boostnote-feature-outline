# Text Formatting

Boostnote's advanced formatting options beyond basic Markdown (some of them are
non-standardized Markdown extensions) are listed in this category.

## Blocks

This section collates all formatting options that are rendered in some kind of
block and are not part of the CommonMark standard.

### Definitions

You can create definitions by having the term on one line by itself, following
by the definition text prefixed with a `:` or a `~`. Note that you can use
Markdown formatting in the definition text.

_Code:_

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```;
Cuneiform
: __Cuneiform__ or __Sumerian cuneiform__, one of the earliest systems of
writing, was invented by the Sumerians. It is distinguished by its wedge-shaped
marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus.
The name _cuneiform_ itself simply means "wedge shaped".

Quipu
~ __Quipu__ (also spelled __khipu__), or __talking knots__, were recording
devices fashioned from strings historically used by a number of cultures in the
region of Andean South America.
```

### Tables

Tables (as well as [task list items](#task-list-items)) are a Markdown extension
in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-).
Note how you can tweak alignment in cells by positioning a colon character at
either the left side, the right or both sides just under the header row for
left, right or center alignment respectively, left alignment being the default.

## References

There are two types of references: footnotes and tooltips.

### Footnotes

_Code:_

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```;
> In mathematical terms, Lacan[^lacan] is here pointing out that the first
> homology group of the sphere is trivial, while those of the other surfaces are
> profound; and this homology is linked with the connectedness or
> disconnectedness of the surface after one or more cuts. Furthermore, as Lacan
> suspected, there is an intimate connection between the external structure of
> the physical world and its inner psychological representation qua knot theory:
> this hypothesis has recently been confirmed by Witten's derivation of knot
> invariants (in particular the Jones polynomial) from three-dimensional
> Chern-Simons quantum field theory.[^sokal]

### Tool Tips

You can add tool tips to any phrase used in a note. The explanation will pop up
as a tool tip when hovering over the phrase and all occurrences of the phrase
itself will be decorated with a subtle dashed line. This is handy, for example,
to provide an explanation for abbreviations.

_Code:_

```;
The DSGB [...] (founded 1959) and the DSA [...] (founded 1944) are separate
organisations with a common aim: to draw attention to the advantages of the
Dozen (or twelve-based) system for numeration and measurement.

*[DSGB]: The Dozenal Society of Great Britain
*[DSA]: The Dozenal Society of America

### Task List Items

Tast list items, just like [Tables](#tables), are a Markdown extension from
[GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/#task-list-items-extension-). When a
note contains one or more task list items, Boostnote will show a progress bar on
top of the note reflecting the proportion of ticked to unticked items. This
effectively turns a note into a nice and simple project planner.

_Code:_

```;
- [x] Try
- [x] Fail
- [ ] Try again
- [ ] Fail better
```

_Result:_
